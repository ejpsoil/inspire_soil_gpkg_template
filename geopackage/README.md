# Geopackage files



The folder "INSPIRE SO empty" contains the empty INSPIRE Geopackage. Only the codelist table has been populated with the necessary codelists available in the INSPIRE registry (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/registry).

**Please note: Some codelists within the geopackage have not been published online yet, while others are internal codelists for managing forms.**

The folder "INSPIRE SO with data" contains the INSPIRE Geopackage with sample data.

The folder "INSPIRE SO with data and QGIS project" contains the INSPIRE Geopackage with sample data, along with data entry and visualization forms.
For proper use, it is necessary to open the QGIS project "SO_PRJ," which you will find inside the geopackage after connecting it to QGIS. 


The file "DB_Schema.png" contains the database schema.
