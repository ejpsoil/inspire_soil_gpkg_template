# Geopackage files



The folder **"INSPIRE_SO_empty"** contains the empty INSPIRE Geopackage. Only the codelist table has been populated with the necessary codelists available in the INSPIRE registry (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/registry).

The folder **"INSPIRE_SO_empty_and_QGIS_project"** contains the INSPIRE Geopackage with entry and visualization forms.
