This folder contains the materials, presentations, and documents from the **EJP SOIL Workshops**, which focus on facilitating the encoding of soil data according to INSPIRE soil data specifications and UML structure. The workshops provide an introduction to the **INSPIRE-SOIL GeoPackage**, practical examples of its use, and advanced methods for data transformation and integration.

The workshops are available on YouTube at the following playlist:
