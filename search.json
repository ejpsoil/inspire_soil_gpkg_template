    "text": "Under the H2020 European Joint Research Programme EJPSOIL, the working package 6 aimed at supporting harmonised soil information and reporting. A so called “Software framework for a shared agricultural soil information system”, deliverable EJP SOIL_D6.4, was produced aimed at enabling transcoding and streamlining of interoperable and harmonised national agricultural soil data into ESDAC, as foreseen in the Grant Agreement, and by general terms enabling INSPIRE compliant soil data sharing.\nThe EJPSOIL_D6.4 builds on the solid foundations of the INSPIRE Directive, taking advantage of the latest developments in the process of modernisation and simplification of its technical requirements in the wider context of the European Strategy for data and the Green Deal Data Space. Key components of the EJPSOIL_D6.4 are a streamlined soil database in GeoPackage encoding format, optimized in view of data compliance to INSPIRE; a data transformation and harmonisation processes; a semantic harmonisation and code list management procedures and tools. The GeoPackage is an SQLite database container that can store both vector and raster data as well as non-spatial data, is a portable, lightweight, and widely compatible across environments, especially efficient where connectivity and bandwidth are limited, and has the advantage to be portable, and can be used directly into GIS applications, such as QGIS. Since November 2022, with the official endorsement of a related INSPIRE Good Practice, the GeoPackage can be used as an alternative (to GML) encoding for the delivery of INSPIRE datasets. In accordance with the INSPIRE Good Practice for the “GeoPackage encoding of INSPIRE datasets”, a logical model for the GeoPackage encoding of Soil data has been developed, starting from the INSPIRE conceptual model and with reference to the classes implemented in the EJPSOIL_D6.4. The model will be made available to the wider INSPIRE community via the INSPIRE Helpdesk and will effectively become a template for those INSPIRE implementers who choose to deliver INSPIRE soil data using the geopackage format.\nThis repository hosts the design of a template for a relational database to capture soil data according to the INSPIRE soil data model.\nThe Good practice on GeoPackage encodings for INSPIRE data introduced a mechanism to share INSPIRE data in a way which makes it much easier for producers to produce the data and consumers to consume the data.\nThe repository has several aspects:\n\nA Documentation with The Project Deliverable 6.4 file describing Encoding rules and other files for the best use the template (as producer or consumer);\nThe Geopackage folder with empty and demo versions\nAn Hale Studio transformation project, which facilitates the transformation of GeoPackage to INSPIRE GML;\nQGIS style files, whith forms to facilitates editing of features;\nA set of SQL statements to update a plain geopackage template to the INSPIRE Soil template.\n\n\nThis activity is performed as part of the ejp soil project, which has received funding of EU under grantnumber 862695"
