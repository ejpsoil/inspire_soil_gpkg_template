# A gpkg template for the INSPIRE Soil theme

This repository hosts the design of a template for a relational database to capture soil data according to the INSPIRE soil data model.

The [Good practice on GeoPackage encodings for INSPIRE data](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-geopackage-encodings) introduced a mechanism to share INSPIRE data in a way which makes it much easier for producers to produce the data and consumers to consume the data.

The repository has several aspects:
- A Documentation on how to best use the template (as producer or consumer);
- An [Hale Studio](https://wetransform.to/halestudio/) transformation project, which facilitates the transformation of GeoPackage to INSPIRE GML;
- [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) style files, whith forms to facilitates editing of features;
- A set of SQL statements to update a plain geopackage template to the INSPIRE Soil template.
