# A gpkg template for the INSPIRE Soil theme

This repository hosts the design of a template for a relational database to capture soil data according the INSPIRE soil data model.

The [Good practice on GeoPackage encodings for INSPIRE data](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-geopackage-encodings) introduced a mechanism to share INSPIRE data in a way which makes it much easier for producers to produce the data and consumers to consume the data.

The repository has 3 aspects
- A set of SQL statements to update a plain geopackage template to a INSPIRE Soil template
- Documentation on how to best use the template (as a producer as well as a consumer)
- A [Hale Studio](https://wetransform.to/halestudio/) transformation project, which facilitates the transformation of GeoPackage to INSPIRE GML.
