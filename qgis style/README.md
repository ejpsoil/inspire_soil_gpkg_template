# Custom attribute form to facilitate data entry and consultation

Customized forms to load for each individual table in QGIS. 
In this phase, we use this system for better form management. Later, the forms will be saved directly within the Geopackage.

**Please note: The style files are still in progress, so they may appear incomplete and in some cases may even function incorrectly.**
